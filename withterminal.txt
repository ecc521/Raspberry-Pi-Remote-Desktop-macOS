Get IP Addresses with Terminal:
arp -a

Note: This application does a little more to try and get IP addresses. I'll look at adding that here.


How to Remote Desktop with terminal:

First, ssh into pi:
ssh piUsername@piipAddress


In Pi:
sudo apt-get install tightvncserver

#Change vncserver password (optional)
vncpasswd

#A view only password is a second password that can view the screen, but cannot make changes

#configure screen size and color depth
vncserver :1 -geometry WIDTHxHEIGHT -depth 24



On Mac:
open vnc://myUsername@piIpAddress:5901
- The password to use is the one input in the vnc server

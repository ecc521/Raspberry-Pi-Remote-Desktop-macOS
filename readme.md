How to install:
- Download the latest release at https://github.com/ecc521/Raspberry-Pi-Remote-Desktop-macOS/releases
- Unzip the archive
- Drag the app to your Applications folder (Optional)

Note: I don't currently pay Apple $99 per year to get a developer certificate - so to open the app you will have to go into System Preferences > Security and Privacy > Click "Open Anyway"



How to build from source:
- Make sure you have electron-packager installed
- Clone the repository or download the zip
- cd into the directory
- Run the build.sh shell script
- Drag the app to your Applications folder (Optional)

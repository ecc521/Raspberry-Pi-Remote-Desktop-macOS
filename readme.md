How to install:
- Download the latest release at https://github.com/ecc521/Raspberry-Pi-Remote-Desktop-macOS/releases
- Unzip the archive
- Open the app (Note: I don't currently pay Apple $99 per year to get a developer certificate - so you likely will have to go into System Preferences > Security and Privacy > Click "Open Anyway")
